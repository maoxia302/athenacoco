A socket based program for any private transfers or any form of communication

For any way of communication that you can adapt into this project. this is only a framework.
I'm currently using this for remote IoT devices to drag file bytes into hardware and execute update commands. 
so there are codes on that part already.

Buffer size can be set freely depends on your demand. I find max 4096 to be most suitable for my scenario.

There's alot of space for opptimization and modifications on the speed of transfer and socket communication.
